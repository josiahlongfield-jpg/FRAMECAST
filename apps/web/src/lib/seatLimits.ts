/**
 * Keeps a workspace's clients and staff within what its plan pays for.
 *
 * Owners can't move to a smaller plan or fewer seats until they fit (see
 * planChange.ts and the seats routes). When a plan drops on its own (a
 * subscription is cancelled or lapses, or a free plan we gave ends), the
 * clients and staff over the new limits are paused: they can't open anything
 * or be sent anything until the owner removes others or upgrades. The longest
 * standing clients and staff keep access; the owner always does. Nothing is
 * deleted, and pauses lift by themselves when seats free up.
 *
 * Telling staff and clients about the change is the owner's job (Terms §5);
 * we email the owner when someone is paused.
